changed makefile

moved into scalr function, using the multiply of c to let the compiler handle it

missing include with imm. from manual foudn isntruction that perfectly express our needs in a single operation: mulhrs_epi16

to avoid strange behavior, make user stick to a multiple of 16 as number of items ( to handle also 256 bit AVX)

need to specify -mavx to enable 256bit SIMD

simplied parameters by setting march-native

AVX instructions cause segmentation fault due to unaligned memory (the operation itself does not require aligned memory, but load and sotre does)

fixed this by changing malloc with aligned_alloc(32, that enforces a 32-byte align on malloc, thus solving th problem at the root)

#of iterations vs variance
size of data/ improvement vs linear (optimum)
openmp see difference vs linear ideal speedup
